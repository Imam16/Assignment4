We both agreed to do pretty much every function in our codes, however, for the documentation we divided the tasks.
Thurein did:
  Add/remove courses from the system (admin) 
  Log-in, log-out (all users)
  Search all courses (all users)
  Search courses based on parameters (all users)
  A menu to implement the use-cases
